# xorer
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/archshift/xorer.svg?branch=master)

A XORPad applier for decrypting 3DS files

## Using xorer
Using the program is easy. After it is built, simply run it from the command line with the 3DS application as the first argument, and the xorpad files as the subsequent arguments. Example:
```
xorer someapp.app -e exheader.xorpad -x exefs.xorpad -r romfs.xorpad
```
Note that the exheader, EXEFS, and ROMFS xorpads must be placed in that specific order. If the input NCCH contains no ROMFS, just omit it from the arguments.

If the program is a 7.x type program and you have both an `exefs_norm.xorpad` and an `exefs_7x.xorpad` file, specify the 7x variant as well using `-7 exefs_7x.xorpad`. If you've already merged them through some other means, just pass the merged file in with `-x`.

## Building xorer
Building the program is even easier. Simply navigate to the directory, make a new build directory, and run cmake then make.
```
cd /path/to/xorer
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Obviously you'll first need to install cmake in order to build xorer.
